### Purpose ###
TAs and student assistants get a ton of questions. Some are well-researched, and some...are not. This is a handy guide that'll help you move away from the latter and towards the former. (Oh, and did I mention that this is an easy way to score points with your internship managers?)

### Ask yourself... ###

- Am I running on EWS?
- **Did I check the man pages?**
- Have I searched for similar questions/followups on Piazza?
- Have I read the MP/DS specification completely?
- Have I watched all of the videos?
- **Did I Google the error message** (and a few permutations thereof if necessary)?
- Did I try commenting out, printlining, and/or stepping through parts of the code bit by bit to find out precisely where the error occurs?
- **Did I commit my code to SVN in case the TAs need more context?**
- Did I include the console/GDB/Valgrind output **AND** code surrounding the bug in my Piazza post?
- Have I fixed other segmentation faults not related to the issue I'm having?
- Am I following good programming practice? (i.e. encapsulation, functions to limit repetition, etc)
